\arguments{
\item{fact_type}{}

\item{date}{The date given either as a formatted GEDCOM string, or a
\code{class_date_value} object.}

\item{place}{see territory}

\item{address}{The address given either as a \code{class_address} object or as a character string.
This would be as written on a mailing label with new lines separated by \n.}

\item{phone_numbers}{}

\item{date_sort}{The date given either as a formatted GEDCOM string, or a
\code{class_date_sort} object.}

\item{note_xrefs}{A character vector of relevant note record cross-reference identifiers.}

\item{notes}{Associated notes. This can either be a \code{class_note} object, a list of them,
or a character vector of notes. If a character vector is provided then only the notes themselves
can be recorded (and not associated information). This option is easier if
associated information is not required.}

\item{citations}{Associated sources. This can either be a \code{class_citation} object, a list of them,
or a character vector of XREFs of source records. If a character vector is provided then only the XREFs themselves
can be recorded (and not associated information). This option is easier if
associated information is not required.}

\item{media_links}{Associated multimedia. This can either be a \code{class_media_link} object, a list of them,
or a character vector of XREFs of multimedia records. If a character vector is provided then only the XREFs themselves
can be recorded (and not associated information). This option is easier if
associated information is not required.}

\item{unique_ids}{A character vector of enduring and globally-unique identifiers. These need
to be formatted in line with RFC 4122 and can be generated with \code{uuid::UUIDgenerate()}.}
}
\value{
An S7 object representing a GEDCOM FAMILY_EVENT_DETAIL (plus a bit more).
