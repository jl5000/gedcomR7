\arguments{
\item{language}{A character string of language tags as defined in BCP 47.}

\item{ext_ids}{A named character vector of identifiers maintained by an external authority.
The names must be given as a URI. See the GEDCOM specification for more information.}

\item{note_xrefs}{A character vector of relevant note record cross-reference identifiers.}

\item{notes}{Associated notes. This can either be a \code{class_note} object, a list of them,
or a character vector of notes. If a character vector is provided then only the notes themselves
can be recorded (and not associated information). This option is easier if
associated information is not required.}
