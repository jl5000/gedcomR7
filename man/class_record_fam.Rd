\arguments{
\item{xref}{The cross-reference identifier for this record. You should not edit this at all
as maintenance of these is done automatically.}

\item{user_ids}{fwe}

\item{unique_ids}{A character vector of enduring and globally-unique identifiers. These need
to be formatted in line with RFC 4122 and can be generated with \code{uuid::UUIDgenerate()}.}

\item{ext_ids}{dsfse}

\item{note_xrefs}{A character vector of relevant note record cross-reference identifiers.}

\item{notes}{Associated notes. This can either be a \code{class_note} object, a list of them,
or a character vector of notes. If a character vector is provided then only the notes themselves
can be recorded (and not associated information). This option is easier if
associated information is not required.}

\item{citations}{Associated sources. This can either be a \code{class_citation} object, a list of them,
or a character vector of XREFs of source records. If a character vector is provided then only the XREFs themselves
can be recorded (and not associated information). This option is easier if
associated information is not required.}

\item{media_links}{Associated multimedia. This can either be a \code{class_media_link} object, a list of them,
or a character vector of XREFs of multimedia records. If a character vector is provided then only the XREFs themselves
can be recorded (and not associated information). This option is easier if
associated information is not required.}

\item{created}{A \code{class_creation_date} object containing the date the record was created.
Creating an object with no parameters sets the date to today.}

\item{updated}{A \code{class_change_date} object containing the date the record was updated.
Creating an object with no parameters sets the date to today.}

\item{husb_xref, wife_xref, chil_xrefs}{The cross-reference identifier(s) of the member's individual records.
If the individual does not have a record, then the value "@VOID@" can be used.
However, you will need to describe the individual by using a named vector (a description can be used
in either case), e.g. c("Joe Bloggs" = "@VOID@") or c("Joe Bloggs" = "@I1@")}

\item{subm_xrefs}{A character vector of relevant submitter record cross-reference identifiers.}
}
\value{
An S7 object representing a GEDCOM FAMILY_RECORD.
}
\description{
Create a family record object
