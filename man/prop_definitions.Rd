\arguments{
\item{full}{A full address as it would appear on a mailing label, with lines separated

\item{media_type}{The media type as defined in RFC 2045.}

\item{translations}{A \code{class_translation_txt} object or a list of them.
One for each alternate translation of the text.}

\item{title}{The title of the multimedia record. This will supersede any title given

\item{where}{A specific location within the information referenced. For a published work, this could
include the volume of a multi-volume work and the page number or numbers. For a
periodical, it could include volume, issue, and page numbers. For a newspaper, it could
include a date, page number, and column number. For an unpublished source or micro‐
filmed works, this could be a film or sheet number, page number, or frame number. A
census record might have an enumerating district, page number, line number, dwelling
number, and family number.
It is recommended that the data in this field be formatted comma-separated with label:
value pairs}

\item{source_text}{A verbatim copy of any description contained within the source. This can
either be a \code{class_translation_txt} object, a list of them, or a character vector of text.
If any \code{class_translation_txt} objects are provided, then you will be forced to define an
associated language or media type.}

\item{fact_type}{}

\item{fact_phrase}{Textual information that cannot be expressed in the fact type.}

\item{role}{What role this person played in this fact.}

\item{role_phrase}{Textual information that cannot be expressed in the role.}

\item{certainty}{An enumerated value indicating the credibility of a
piece of information, based on its supporting evidence. Some systems use this feature to
rank multiple conflicting opinions for display of most likely information first. It is not
intended to eliminate the receivers’ need to evaluate the evidence for themselves.
"0" = unreliable/estimated data
"1" = Questionable reliability of evidence
"2" = Secondary evidence, data officially recorded sometime after event
"3" = Direct and primary evidence used, or by dominance of the evidence}

The latitude coordinate is the direction North or South from the equator in degrees and
fraction of degrees. The longitude coordinate is in degrees and fraction of degrees East
or West of the zero or base meridian coordinate.
For example: 18 degrees, 9 minutes, and 3.4 seconds North, 168 degrees, 9 minutes, and
3.4 seconds East would be formatted as "N18.150944 E168.150944".}

treated as private. This allows them to be excluded on export.}

\item{age, husb_age, wife_age}{A character string that indicates the age in years, months, weeks and/or days
that the individual was at the time of the fact. Any combination of these is permitted.
Any labels must come after their corresponding number, for example; "4y 8m 1w 3d".
Age bounds can also be included, for example; "< 40y". If the age doesn't fit this format then describe the age
in the corresponding phrase parameter.}

provided then only the fact types themselves can be recorded (and not associated information).
This option is easier if associated information is not required. For example, a parish register of
births, deaths, and marriages would be "BIRT, DEAT, MARR". The \code{val_fact_types()} function gives a
list of possible fact types.}

\item{originator}{The person, agency, or entity who created the record. For a published work,
this could be the author, compiler, transcriber, abstractor, or editor. For an unpublished

does not have a record, then this can be left blank and the value "@VOID@" will be used. However,
you will need to define an @indi_phrase.}

\item{fam_xref}{The cross-reference identifier of a family record.}

\item{sour_xref}{The cross-reference identifier of a source record. If the source
does not have a record, then this can be left blank and the value "@VOID@" will be used. However,
you will need to describe the source in @where.}

\item{repo_xref}{The cross-reference identifier of a repository record. If the repository
does not have a record, then this can be left blank and the value "@VOID@" will be used. However,
you will need to describe the repository in @notes.}

whose records also represent this individual. The vector names may provide a description of these records.}

\item{anci_xrefs, desi_xrefs}{A character vector of relevant submitter record cross-reference identifiers
who are interested in the ancestors/descendants of this individual.}

\item{unique_ids}{A character vector of enduring and globally-unique identifiers. These need
to be formatted in line with RFC 4122 and can be generated with \code{uuid::UUIDgenerate()}.}

\item{user_ids}{A character vector of user-generated identifiers. The type of the identifiers can
be given in the vector names, e.g. c("Driving license number" = "ABC123")}

\item{ext_ids}{A named character vector of identifiers maintained by an external authority.
The names must be given as a URI. See the GEDCOM specification for more information.}

\item{media_links}{Associated multimedia. This can either be a \code{class_media_link} object, a list of them,
