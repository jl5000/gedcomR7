\arguments{
\item{date}{The date given either as a formatted GEDCOM string, or a
\code{class_date_value} object.}

\item{temple_name}{TODO}

\item{place}{see territory}

\item{ord_state}{TODO}

\item{state_date}{The ordinance date given either as a formatted GEDCOM string, or a
\code{class_date_exact} object.}

\item{state_time}{The ordinance time given either as a formatted GEDCOM string, or a
\code{class_time} object.}

\item{note_xrefs}{A character vector of relevant note record cross-reference identifiers.}

\item{notes}{Associated notes. This can either be a \code{class_note} object, a list of them,
or a character vector of notes. If a character vector is provided then only the notes themselves
can be recorded (and not associated information). This option is easier if
associated information is not required.}

\item{citations}{Associated sources. This can either be a \code{class_citation} object, a list of them,
or a character vector of XREFs of source records. If a character vector is provided then only the XREFs themselves
can be recorded (and not associated information). This option is easier if
associated information is not required.}
