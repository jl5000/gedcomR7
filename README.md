# gedcomS7

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `gedcomS7` is to handle genealogical data as GEDCOM files.
This package succeeds the `tidyged` package and the other packages in
the `gedcompendium`.

The package will greatly improve upon its predecessor packages and will have minimal dependencies.

> This package is still under heavy development. It should not be used at this time.
