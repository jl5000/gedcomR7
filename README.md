# gedcomR7

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of gedcomR7 is to handle genealogical data as GEDCOM files.
This package succeeds the `tidyged` package and the other packages in
the `gedcompendium`. It has just one dependency - the R7 package for
Object Oriented Programming, which will at some point be subsumed into
base R. NOTE: this package is likely to change name soon.

> This package is still in development. Be wary of editing your file
> with it for the time being.
